Title: Launch a distributed R server on a cluster from a remote R session
Version: 0.1-0
Description: Provides ease of use and configuration components for
    controlling a distributed set of R instances on a cluster from a
    remote R session (e.g. running on a laptop with RStudio). Other
    parallel approaches (multicore, multithreading, and GPU) are
    compatible with a launchr() distributed server session, which provides
    a means of specifying the number of R sessions per node, leaving cores
    available for these shared-memory applications. The intent is to
    provide an easy-to-use interactive SPMD-style develpment platform for
    distributed parallel programming in R. Leave BIG data on BIG platforms
    and control its analysis using R codes on your laptop.
